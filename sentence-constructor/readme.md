# Hungarian Sentence Constructor

---

## Business Goal:

A chat agent that acts as a teaching assistant to guide students from translating a target English sentence into Hungarian. The teaching assistant is not there to provide the direct answer, only guidance.

_Will AI-Powered Assistants replace real teachers?_

### Technical Uncertainty

- How well can an AI-Powered Assistant perform a very broad task?
- Would a very broad task be better performed by dividing it into subtasks with specialized agents?
- Does using an AI-Powered Assistant make for a good place to rapidly prototype agents?
- How could we take the agent we built in an AI-Powered Assistant and reimplement it into a stack that allows for direct integration into our platform?
- How much do we have to rework our prompt documents from one AI-Powered Assistant to another?
- What prompting techniques can we naturally discover working in the confines of an AI-Powered Assistant?
- Are there any interesting innovations unique to specific AI-Powered Assistants for our business goal?
- What were we able to achieve based on our AI-Powered Assistant choice and our hardware, or budget limitations?

### Technical Restrictions

An AI-Powered Assistant of the developerâ€™s choice must be used eg:

Anthropic Claude https://www.anthropic.com/claude
Mistral AI https://mistral.ai/
*Ollama + Open WebUI https://openwebui.com/
